# Brain-Tumor
This project is an end-to-end Brain Tumor Detection System that uses Machine Learning and Image Processing to detect brain tumors from MRI images.
The system classifies MRI scans into tumor and non-tumor categories and provides predictions through a desktop-based graphical user interface (GUI).
All predictions are also stored in a MySQL database for future analysis and record keeping.
